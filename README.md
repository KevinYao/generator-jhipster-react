## Installation

**Attention: This is still a work in progress**

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/), then install generator-jhipster-react using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-jhipster
npm install -g generator-jhipster-react
```

Then generate your new awesome project:

```bash
yo jhipster-react
```
As this is a generator which runs on top of [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/), we expect you have [JHipster and its related tools already installed](http://jhipster.github.io/installation.html).

This generator requires Jhipster version 2.27 or greater in order to work

## Development-mode

Frontend is working through [webpack-dev-server](webpack-dev-server-url) proxy mode feature in order to have an ability to use both frontend & backend server simultaneously. All requests from frontend would be proxied to backend server.

To start frontend server please run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
